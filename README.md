dynamically hide  1- name of employee  2- relationship with employee 3- workplace  when entering category B patient's data. Make page look attractive by using pictures and dynamic using frontend technologies like html, css, javascript.  another login id will be of a doctor ,  who can view  patient's registration and details entered by the receptionist. doctor's portal will have space to prescribe medicine or recommendations for lab testing.   then we will have a login id for pharmacist, who will be able to see doctor's prescribed medicine's data, if a medicne is not available pharmacist will put a cross using a checkbox given.  The final report can be generated and a print can be given to the patient and also a copy of the form will be sent to mobile number and e mail id.  Another  login id will be for lab testers, they will be able to see doctor's prescribed lab tests, if test is not available they will put a cross in form using a checkbox, and generates a print of the form. there will be a login id for patients where they can login using there phone number or opd no.   previous prescribed forms of pateints are visible to them. Use backend technologies – PHP and my sql. It should also have a admin pannel to see all the activity. Start from creating first file structure ,then database then according to file write code – use PHP ,mysql to create and internal css and js for each page start . make each page attractive using different fonts and pictures, according to context.
